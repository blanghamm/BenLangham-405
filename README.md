This program translates SpaceX data from an api into bite sized chunks. I have choosen to diplay this information using visual markers. When the user hovers their mouse over the selected rocket it will reveal information regarding it's launch data, rocket name, rocket type and launch loctation. I tried to keep the amount of data to a minimium as not to overwhelm the user with a large chunk of data.

The break down of the directory contains. The individual scripts with the code being commented on to highlight what each function does. The main breakdown of the code being "if" statements that allow the specific parameter to change once the mouse is moved to hover over one of the rockets.
