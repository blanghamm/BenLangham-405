This program translates SpaceX data from an api into bite sized chunks. I have chosen to display this information using visual markers. When the user hovers their mouse over the selected rocket it will reveal information regarding it's launch data, rocket name, rocket type and launch location. I tried to keep the amount of data to a minimum as not to overwhelm the user with a large chunk of data.

When I started the project the idea was to have each rocket display data from every launch that spaceX had completed but the limitations of p5 made this difficult as I could only fit so many images on screen. This led me to refining the idea down to more specific date range. Overall the way the api data has been incorporated into the code makes it very easy to change the date ranges and display different data if you so choose.
 
The break down of the directory contains. The individual scripts with the code being commented on to highlight what each function does. The main breakdown of the code being "if" statements that allow the specific parameter to change once the mouse is moved to hover over one of the rockets.
